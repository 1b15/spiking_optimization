updating one neuron at a time: network to eventually violate constraints to find good states

energy function sensitive to hyperparameters

evaluation circuitry

biological plausibility, optimization in neuroscience (motor control?)

not general purpose algorithms for larger class of optimization problems
(Loihi uses different algorithm for QP)
